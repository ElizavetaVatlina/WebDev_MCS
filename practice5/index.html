				<div class="firstcolumn"> 1. Pinch Pots.
				Begin a pinch pot by forming a lump of clay into a smooth sphere that fits the size of the hand. This method is similar to the way the Native Americans shaped clay into useful pots. While holding the sphere of clay, press the thumb into the center of the ball, half-way to the bottom. While revolving the ball in one hand, press the walls out evenly with the thumb into the inside and the fingers on the outside. Smooth the surface with a damp sponge.</div>
				<div class="secondcolumn"> 2. Coil Method. Coils of clay can be used to build bowls, vases and other forms in various shapes and sizes. Keeping the fingers flat, form the clay into sausage shapes, then roll into ropes 1/4 to 1/2 inches thick. Make a shallow dish with the pinch pot method and turn up-side down to serve as a foot of base. Place a coil along the edge of the foot. Dampen the fingers and join the next coil to it, with a little pressure. Keep adding coils . Coils may be pressed with the fingers or a tool on both the inside and outside to create interesting texture.</div>
				<div class="thirdcolumn"> 3. Slab Method. Place two strips of wood on canvas a little further apart than the width of the finished slabs. Working on a textured fabric will leave imprints on the clay slab. Place clay on the cloth between the strips of wood and roll out. Use a pointed tool to trim the slab of clay to desired size. You may make paper patterns to follow if a form that has a number of sides is desired. Rub a wet finger over the edges to be joined and score with a tool. Roll out a thin coil of sticky clay and place it along one edge. Press the two edges together. Slabs of clay may be placed over rocks, bowls, plastic forms etc. to create interesting shapes. As the clay dries, it shrinks away from the form but retains the shape of the form.</div>

		<div class="bottomsection">The potter’s wheel, often referred to as the process of “throwing,” was invented around 3,500 B.C. in Mesopotamia in modern-day Iraq, and it remains one of the most significant inventions of all time. The wheel’s centrifugal force allowed potters to create vessels with unmatched speed and quality, enabling the formation of thinner and more refined vessels than was previously possible with handbuilding techniques. The invention of the wheel is largely accountable for the more than 100,000 vessels that survive from ancient Greece. The complex wheel-throwing process used to create the famous Greek red-figure/black-figure vessels often demanded two or more sessions of firing. The objects were painted with a slip before the third firing—usually with scenes of war, agriculture, and ceremony, or abstract, geometric designs.
Welch points out the potential for innovation that the wheel ushered in. “In the 1950s, the wheel was seen as the source of the greatest freedom, but that was probably linked to its view as a device to churn out pots,” says Welch. “So using it to [experiment] was all the more glorious.” The Haas Brothers continue to utilize the wheel to create forms that elicit the curiosities of sexuality, psychedelia, intimacy, and nature—and to comment on contemporary culture as a whole. Strange, quirky, lush, and erotic, the objects created by the L.A.-based twins manifest a wide range of sensations, materials, and techniques. It’s their “Unique, Hand-thrown” works particularly, however, that convey a certain timelessness, suggesting methods of the past.
How it Works
Drop a kneaded ball of clay with some force onto the center of the wheel head. With a bowl of water, wet hands and clay as the wheel spins quickly. Cup clay in your hands and use your legs and core to keep your body steady and to provide extra strength in order to bring it into a tower shape. Pushing the clay down and in simultaneously with the palms of your hands, let extra clay and water disperse from the shape being formed. Keep the clay centered for an even rotation and appearance. Use one hand to find the center of the ball and open it with your fingers as the other hand holds it intact. Once the bottom is compressed, the walls are raised, thinned, and shaped as much as you like, and the top is evened out, let finish and dry.
